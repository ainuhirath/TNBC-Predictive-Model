# TNBC-Predictive-Model
Predictive Model for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Treatment Side-Effects Severity

My wife is currently undergoing cancer treatment for TNBC. It's been a long process with a number of treatment options of varying types.
As I was in the process of ramping up my DS skills, I thought to explore whether some patterns might emerge from other patients' anonymized data to help predict her response.

Objective: Develop a predictive model using patient-reported side-effect data from chemotherapy or radiation treatment in TNBC patients to predict side-effect severity based on clinical characteristics.

Key Data Science Skills Demonstrated:
    Feature Engineering: Deriving useful predictors from clinical data.
    Predictive Modeling: Logistic regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting.
    Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision/Recall, ROC-AUC.
